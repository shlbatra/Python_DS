Depth First Search
Time - O(n)
DataStrcuture - Hashset (to avoid getting into cycle)
If not use recursive then can use Stack as well

Breadth First Search

Time - O(n)
DataStrcuture - Queue (as not done recursively)
Avoid cycle using Hashset again 

Union Find - union together disjoint sets and 
combine together efficiently 
Time - O(nlogn)
DataStructure - Forest of Trees 
Ex - Number of connected components in undirected graph

Topological Sort - Hard, Built on top of DFS, Given Directed 
Acyclical Graph (DAG), read value of node and print in order 
every node before it already processed. 
Time - O(n)
DataStructure - Hashset 
Ex. Alien Dictionary 

Dijkstra Shortest Path Algo - Find shortest path from starting node 
to every other node in graph , can have weighted edges, 
Time - E log V  (E- edges and V - vertices)
Data Structure - Heap or Priorty Queue as look at min of edges 
Hashset to avoid cycle 
Ex - Network Delay Time 

Prim or Kruskal (Minimum Spanning Tree)
Floyd Warshall Algo
